# Diagnosing-Parkinson-s-disease-using-Random-Forests

This Project involved using classification algorithms and ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalize the model for prediction

Skills & Tools Covered:
1. EDA
2. Logistic regression
3. Decision Trees
